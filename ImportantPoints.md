# Important Points:

- The `logarithmic base 10 of a positive integers` gives the number of digits in n. We add 1 to the result to ensure that the count is correct even for numbers that are powers of 10. 
  - We cast the result to an integer to ensure that any fractional part is discarded giving the exact count of digits.
  - Time coplexity: O(1) and space complexity: O(1).
- The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers remains the same even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.
